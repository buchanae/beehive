zeromq vs sge
=============

seems like the work can be accomplished with both, and sge already exists,
so what's the argument for zeromq?

full communication with services

less overhead in job submission

application is self contained. can run on laptop without sge. sge is just for starting
services (resource allocation)



todo
====

test/simulation harness

job IDs, retries, and futures

what happens to replies that are never retrieved by the client?
